# Generate Variations

The Titan Image Generator can create multiple variations of an existing image while maintaining its core elements and style. This feature allows you to explore different interpretations of the same concept by using the ImageVariationTask. When generating variations, you can specify the number of variations to create (between 1-5) and use a seed value to control reproducibility.
