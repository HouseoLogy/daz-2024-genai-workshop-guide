# Replace Object


Object replacement combines inpainting capabilities with prompt-guided generation. You can select an area to modify using either a maskPrompt or maskImage, then provide a text description of the new content to replace it. The model supports a maximum resolution of 1408×1408 and ensures the new element blends naturally with the existing image. For example, you can replace one subject with another (like replacing an existing artwork with a new one) while maintaining the overall composition and lighting of the scene.
