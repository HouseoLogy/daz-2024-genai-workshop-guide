# Remove Background

Background removal in Titan Image Generator v2 uses advanced segmentation capabilities to automatically identify and isolate foreground objects from their background. The model can intelligently detect multiple objects in the foreground and cleanly separate them, even when they overlap with other elements. The output is provided with a transparent background, making it ideal for creating product images or preparing assets for various marketing materials. This feature is exclusive to the v2 model and requires no manual masking input from the user.
