## Configuration Guide

When using Titan Image Generator, you have several configuration options and actions to control your image generation:

### Available Actions
- **Generate Image**: Create a new image from your prompt
- **Generate Variations**: Create variations of an existing image
- **Remove Object**: Remove selected objects from the image
- **Replace Object**: Replace selected objects with new ones
- **Remove Background**: Remove the background, keeping only the main subject

### Basic Configuration

#### Negative Prompt
Enter terms describing what you want to avoid in your image.  
Example: â€™bad quality, blurry, distorted, pixelatedâ€™

#### Response Image Settings
- **Orientation**
  - Landscape
  - Portrait
- **Size**: 1024 x 1024 pixels (standard size, several options available)
- **Number of Images**: Generate 1-5 images per run (slider control)

### Advanced Configurations

#### Prompt Strength
- Scale: 1-10 (default: 8)
- Higher values: Stronger adherence to prompt
- Lower values: More creative freedom by the model

#### Seed
- Numerical value (e.g., 0)
- Use specific seeds to recreate exact results
- Same seed + same prompt = same image

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Keep a fixed seed value if you want to recreate or iterate on a specific generation

---

These settings allow you to configure your image generation process and maintain consistency across multiple generations when needed.
