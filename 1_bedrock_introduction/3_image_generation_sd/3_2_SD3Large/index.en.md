**SD3 Large 1.0** strikes a balance between generation speed and output quality. Ideal for creating high-volume, high-quality digital assets like websites, newsletters, and marketing materials.

When using SD3 Large 1.0 you have several configuration options and actions to control your image generation:

### Available Actions for SD3 Large 1.0
- **Generate Image**: Create a new image from your prompt
- **Generate Variations**: Create variations of an existing image

### Basic Configuration

Majority of Configuration remains the same. Compared to SDXL 1.0, you can define an output format be it jpeg or png.
In SD3 Large you don't have control over the generation steps and prompt strength. This is handled by the model directly.
