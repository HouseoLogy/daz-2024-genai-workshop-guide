# What is ComfyUI

ComfyUI is a powerful, node-based interface for creating content generation workflows. It provides a visual way to create, customize, and chain together different nodes for content generation and manipulation.

Think of it as a visual workflow builder / low-code environment where each node represents a specific action or transformation, and you connect these nodes to create powerful generation pipelines. While its main focus is on image generation and manipulation, the capabilities go far beyond that thanks to an active community creating custom nodes.

With ComfyUI, you can:
- Generate and manipulate images
- Create videos and animations
- Process audio and create visualizations
- And much more through community extensions
