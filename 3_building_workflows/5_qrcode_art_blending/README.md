# QR Code Art Blending Workflow

Learn how to transform QR codes into artistic designs while maintaining their scannable functionality using ControlNet and advanced blending techniques.

The QR code art workflow uses ControlNet for structure preservation:
1. **Load Checkpoint**: dreamshaper-8-sd15 model
2. **Load ControlNet Model**: control_v1p_sd15 for structure guidance
3. **Empty Latent Image**: Sets generation canvas
4. **Load Image**: Your QR code input
5. **Apply ControlNet**: Maintains QR code structure
6. **CLIP Text Encode**: Style and negative prompts
7. **KSampler Advanced**: Precise generation control
8. **VAE Decode**: Final image rendering

## Example Used
**Input Image**  
:image[QR Code]{src='/static/comfyui/workflows/assets/qr-code-input.jpg' width=196}

## Style Prompt
```
sci-fi landscape, dystopian, dune style
```

## Negative prompt
```
bad quality, blurry, pixelated
```

### Key Parameters Explained
- **Size**: 512 x 512 (balanced for QR readability)
- **ControlNet Settings**:
  - Strength: 1.25 (strong structure preservation)
  - Start Percent: 0.077 (early guidance)
  - End Percent: 0.921 (extended control)
- **Sampling Parameters**:
  - Steps: 8 (balanced detail)
  - CFG: 2.0 (style flexibility)
  - Sampler: dpmpp_2m
  - Scheduler: karras

## Practical Use Cases

### Branding
- Custom business QR codes
- Event ticket QR designs
- Brand identity integration

### Marketing
- Interactive advertisements
- Product packaging
- Social media campaigns

### Artistic
- Gallery installations
- Digital art pieces
- Mixed media projects

## Hands-on: Creating Scannable Art

1. Start with a high-contrast QR code
2. Set appropriate ControlNet strength (1.2-1.4)
3. Use descriptive style prompts
4. Test scan after each generation
5. Adjust parameters if needed

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:**
> - Keep high contrast in prompt design for better scanning
> - Test QR code functionality frequently during generation
> - Use ControlNet strength above 1.0 to preserve structure
> - Start_percent near 0.07 helps establish basic structure
> - End_percent around 0.92 maintains readability
> - Lower CFG (1.8-2.2) allows for more artistic freedom while maintaining structure
> - Consider the final use case when selecting resolution

## Optimization Guidelines

### For Better Scannability:
```markdown
- Increase ControlNet strength (1.2-1.4)
- Maintain high contrast in style prompts
- Use larger resolution for complex QR codes
- Keep CFG below 2.5
```

### For More Artistic Freedom:
```markdown
- Reduce ControlNet strength slightly (1.0-1.2)
- Experiment with style prompts
- Use start_percent/end_percent for controlled variation
- Consider multiple generation attempts
```
