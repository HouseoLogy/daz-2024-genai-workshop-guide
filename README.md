# Creative generative AI Workshop

Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll explore the exciting world of generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and ComfyUI. In this workshop, you'll learn how to create, manipulate, and automate image generation using state-of-the-art AI models.

## What you will learn

Throughout this workshop, you'll gain hands-on experience with:
- Creating custom images using Amazon Bedrock's AI models (Titan Image Generator and Stable Diffusion)
- Building and automating image generation workflows with ComfyUI
- Developing a full-stack AI Avatar generation application
- Working with advanced models like Flux and Stable Diffusion 3

## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is ideal for:
- Software developers with interest in image / video generation
- Game designer / developer
- Digital artists and designers
- Tech and generative AI enthusiasts

No prior experience with AI or AWS is required.

## Technical requirements
